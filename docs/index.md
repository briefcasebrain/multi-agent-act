## Overview

The Multi-Agent Collaborative Learning Library provides a robust framework for creating and orchestrating complex multi-agent learning scenarios. Built with extensibility and performance in mind, it enables researchers and developers to explore various forms of collaborative intelligence.

### Key Features

- **🏆 Competitive Learning Tournaments**: ELO-ranked tournaments with adaptive strategies
- **👨‍🏫 Mentor-Student Networks**: Knowledge distillation and teaching effectiveness tracking
- **🔬 Collaborative Research**: Discovery systems with cross-domain knowledge transfer
- **🎭 Scenario Orchestration**: Sequential scenario execution with cross-learning analysis
- **📊 Rich Visualization**: Learning curves, collaboration networks, and performance analytics
- **🔧 Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for custom scenarios and learning algorithms

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# From PyPI (coming soon)
pip install multi-agent-collab-learning

# From source
git clone https://github.com/briefcasebrain/multi-agent-collab-learning.git
cd multi-agent-collab-learning
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Example

```python
from multi_agent_collab_learning import (
    ScenarioOrchestrator,
    CompetitiveLearningTournament,
    ScenarioConfig,
    LearningScenarioType
)

# Create agents (your implementation)
agents = create_your_agents()

# Configure tournament
config = ScenarioConfig(
    scenario_type=LearningScenarioType.COMPETITIVE_TOURNAMENT,
    duration_episodes=50,
    participants=len(agents)
)

# Create and run tournament
tournament = CompetitiveLearningTournament(agents, config)
results = tournament.run(environment)

print(f"Winner: {results['tournament_winner']}")
```

## Architecture

## Scenarios

### Competitive Learning Tournaments

Implements tournament-style competition between agents with:
- Round-robin and bracket tournament formats
- ELO-style performance ranking system
- Competitive behavior detection and analysis
- Strategy innovation metrics

### Mentor-Student Networks

Creates mentorship relationships where experienced agents teach others through:
- Neural knowledge distillation
- Teaching effectiveness tracking
- Adaptive mentorship relationship management
- Learning progress monitoring

### Collaborative Research Environments

Enables multi-team research coordination with:
- Discovery and breakthrough detection systems
- Cross-domain knowledge sharing mechanisms
- Innovation metrics calculation
- Research team formation and management
